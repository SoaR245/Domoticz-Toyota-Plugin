# Domoticz-Toyota-Plugin 0.0.1
A Domoticz plugin that provides sensors for a Toyota car with connected services.

It is using the same API that is used by the Toyota MyT connected services. This API is however only useable
for cars that are purchased in Europe. For more information of Toyota MyT see:

The Toyota car should first be made available in the MyT connected services, after which this plugin
can retrieve the information, which is then provided as several sensors in Domoticz.
